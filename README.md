# The Simon Game

Simon Game is a game, inspired by and working like the game "Simon". It was made using Javascript, jQuery, DOM Manipulation, HTML and CSS. 


**Challenge from the course "The Complete 2021 Web Development Bootcamp by Dr. Angela Yu".**

## How it works:

Instructions:

Press any key on your keyboard to start the game.

Follow the sequence dictated by the game, pressing the buttons, using a mouse or a cursor. 

If you succeed, you will go on to the next level!

If you fail, the game will end.

You can always start a new game by pressing any key again!

The game makes sounds whenever a button is pressed by the game or by the player. Each button has a corresponding sound. 
When the player presses a wrong button, the game makes a specific sound for "wrong" and the screen flashes in red.
